    - It shows the search result with an option to add them to favourite meals list and to know more information about it. 

### Meal Detail Page
    - It contains detailed description of the meal

### My Favourite Meals Page
    - It displays the list of all meals added to favourite
    - The list is persistent (number of meals will remain same before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser). I have made use of local storgae to achieve this.
